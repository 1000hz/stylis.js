## Experimental rewrite

The idea is experiment with going full-on with shipping es modules with the lessons learned, and see how small, how fast, and how modular we can go.

Currently the rewrite sits comfortably just under 2kb, with a theoratical performance improvement(haven't test anything yet). This estimate includes the prefixere so excluded this would sit within the low-range ballpark of around ~1kb.

In comparision the current version sits around ~4kb.
